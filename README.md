To anyone from the public viewing this, this is a sample of the code for TweetBot. This repo was mostly intended to pass data between members of the team working on it.
This code in its intirety compiles in visual studio in the form of a Windows Desktop app.
Please note that the majority of actual code is in the files source.cpp, mainpage.xaml and mainpage.xaml.cpp.
(Also, many functions in mainpage may seem very repetitive, unfortunately due to the nature of the program at hand some core data(such as location names) were stored in the form of these functions.)

FAQ: Ever heard of arrays?
	
A: Unfortunately, Xaml requires that all objects are stored individually...
